class LabelCooccurrenceGraphBuilder(GraphBuilderBase):
    """Base class providing API and common functions for all label
    co-occurence based multi-label classifiers.

    This graph builder constructs a Label Graph based on the output matrix where two label nodes are connected
    when at least one sample is labeled with both of them. If the graph is weighted, the weight of an edge between two
    label nodes is the number of samples labeled with these two labels. Self-edge weights contain the number of samples
    with a given label.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weighted: bool
        decide whether to generate a weighted or unweighted graph.
    include_self_edges : bool
        decide whether to include self-edge i.e. label 1 - label 1 in
        co-occurrence graph
    normalize_self_edges: bool
        if including self edges, divide the (i, i) edge by 2.0, requires include_self_edges=True
