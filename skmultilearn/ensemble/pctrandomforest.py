class RandomForestClassifier(ForestClassifier):
    """A random forest classifier.

    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree
    classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to
    improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    The sub-sample size is always the same as the original
    input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if
    `bootstrap=True` (default).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=10)
        The number of trees in the forest.

    criterion : string, optional (default="gini")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "entropy" for the information gain.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default="auto")
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a percentage and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)` (same as "auto").
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    max_depth : integer or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.
        Ignored if ``max_leaf_nodes`` is not None.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    min_samples_split : integer, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    min_samples_leaf : integer, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples in newly created leaves.  A split is
        discarded if after the split, one of the leaves would contain less then
        ``min_samples_leaf`` samples.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the input samples required to be at a
        leaf node.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
        If not None then ``max_depth`` will be ignored.
        Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.

    oob_score : bool
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate
        the generalization error.

    n_jobs : integer, optional (default=1)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.

    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    class_weight : dict, list of dicts, "balanced", "balanced_subsample" or None, optional

        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

        The "balanced_subsample" mode is the same as "balanced" except that weights are
        computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree grown.

        For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    classes_ : array of shape = [n_classes] or a list of such arrays
        The classes labels (single output problem), or a list of arrays of
        class labels (multi-output problem).

    n_classes_ : int or list
        The number of classes (single output problem), or a list containing the
        number of classes for each output (multi-output problem).

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.

    oob_decision_function_ : array of shape = [n_samples, n_classes]
        Decision function computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training
        set. If n_estimators is small it might be possible that a data point
        was never left out during the bootstrap. In this case,
        `oob_decision_function_` might contain NaN.
